The basic premise is to render a scene at a higher than target resolution, apply a Gaussian blur to the whole image, and then scale it down to the target resolution. In any case it is assumed you render the scene for the same duration. Generally this means that a scene at say 1920x1080 with a target of 1024 SPP could be rendered at 3840x2160 at 256 SPP- These should take the same amount of time to render and the 2160p image would have perceptually less noise than the same scene rendered natively at 1080p. The noise is still present but given the higher resolution each pixel of noise takes up less screen space compared to the “noiseless” data from the sun/sky. Blurring and scaling to target resolution should result in better results than rendering at native resolution. Increasing the canvas resolution does increase memory consumption.

The noisy emitter pass could then be filtered with a Selective Gaussian Blur in GIMP and then combined. Comparing a typical 400 SPP Sunlight + Raw Emitter image to the Sunlight + Filtered Emitter image it was seen that the lighting was softer and there was less noticeable noise. The different lighting passes can be setup through the Lighting and the Sky &amp; Fog tabs. For a Sunlight pass you would simply need to disable emitters. For an Emitter pass things are a bit more complex: Enable emitters (if not done), disable sunlight, and Sky mode: black OR enable transparent sky. llbit’s example . Sunlight pass at 200 SPP . Emitter pass at 400 SPP . Filtered emitter pass . Sunlight + filtered emitter pass . Same scene rendered at 400 SPP . ",

By rendering the complete scene with emitters at 0.01, emitters would light up but not emit visible light. This would lead to zero emitter noise in the distance. Meaning lower SPPs could be used for this element. Foreground element should be loaded with a reduced number of chunks, to speed up rendering speed, with the chosen emittance. With a careful selection of Chunks and combination of the two elements in post a reasonable result can be achieved. Example . Foreground selection of 76 chunks . 1024 SPP @ 932k SPS - aka it’s fast . Background selection of 1877 chunks . 128 SPP @ 482k SPS - aka it’s slow . Crude composite . The key issue with this technique is that the lighting information in the foreground element would not completely match the background. Further mitigations would be to instead combine this Multi-plane technique with Split Pass to further speed up rendering and retain bounce lighting from Sun/Sky present within the background pass. Using Split Pass would also mean that less effort is required to recombine the completed results. ",

    "content": "First showcased by u/StaysAwakeAllWeek in Nov 2018, this was the first time an AI based denoiser was mentioned on r/Chunky. Unfortunately at the time it was limited to just Nvidia GPUs. A few months later I discovered Intel’s Open Image Denoise; an AI based denoiser that works on any CPU with SSE4.1 support. Example . | SPP | RAW | OIDN | . | 512 | | | . | 2048 | | | . | 4096 | | | . | 8192 | | | . As some of you may have noticed while AI based denoisers work wonders there are a few issues with the outputted images. Noteworthy visual artifacts are the deformed blocks, blurred textures, and the painted effect you can often see. Below you can see an extreme case where a 32 SPP scene lit mostly by emitters was denoised. Example of painted effect . leMaik’s Denoising Plugin . Some of these issues can be resolved or mitigated by using leMaik’s Denoising Plugin which has the ability to, not only to automatically denoise a scene once the target SPP is reached but, render auxiliary feature images / AOVs (Arbitrary Output Variables) to provide additional information to the denoiser. Unfortunately you still can’t expect the AI denoiser to work real magic; If there is too much noise you will still get a painted effect. Albedo Map . The Albedo map is a feature image that provides the largest quality bump to the denoiser. It’s basically just a representation of the texture information within the scene independant of shading (lighting) or viewing angle. This map tends to help restore texture details. Normal Map . The Normal map is another feature image that can help. In order to use a Normal map you need to provide the Denoiser with the Albedo map first. This map tends to help restore block shape. ",

    "content": "For some scenes where we have access to both Sun/Sky light and Emitters. This technique is… well it is mostly a combinaton of llbit’s Split Pass and AI denoising with a touch of my Multi-plane. The goal of this method is to min-max speed and quality as much as possible. As many would probably know by now; Scenes which receive most of their lighting directly from the Sun or Sky generally do not require SPPs past 1000 SPP, and often work fine with 64-256 SPP, unlike scenes with emitters that can require 8000 SPP or more. Subjecting the whole scene to an AI based denoiser when it is not necessary is what this combination technique aims to solve. We take llbit’s Split Pass Denoising and instead of feeding the emitter pass through a simple Gaussian blur we use an AI based denoiser like Nvidia Optix or OIDN. Given the Sun, Sky, and Fog pass is not put through the denoiser any fine details or grain from this pass will be kept. This is most noticeable when looking at the fog as this tends to be heavily blurred by AI Denoisers. Any part of the scene that does not receive lighting from the Sun, Sky, and Fog pass but instead is lit from the emitter pass will still unfortunately be subjected the the pitfalls of the AI Denoiser. However, given that we can reduce the number of chunks loaded for this pass, and that we do not need to deal with fog, it should be possible to achieve a high SPP relatively quickly. Put simply: Render the Sun, Sky, and Fog in one pass. In another pass render the emitters and denoise them with an AI base denoiser like Open Image Denoise or Nvidia Optix. These two passes can be combined using GIMP by setting the layer mode to Screen. Example 1 . Sun + Sky + Fog Pass at 256 SPP . Raw Emitter Pass at 2048 SPP . AI denoised Emitter Pass . Combined SSF + E_dn using GIMP and layer mode set to screen . Example 2 . Sun + Sky + Fog Pass at 256 SPP . Raw Emitter Pass at 2048 SPP . AI denoised Emitter Pass . Combined SSF + E_dn using GIMP and layer mode set to screen . A simple proof of concept with Layer mode: Screen . Below is a showcase of further subdividing light sources into different passes and the combined composite VS a typical render. This is merely to showcase that splitting render passes and combining in post can produce equivalent results to a more typical render. Of course subdividing a scene into this many passes and rendering to such a high SPP is not required for Split Pass + AI Denoising. | Sun pass | Sky pass | Emitter pass | . | | | | . | SSE_Comp | | Typical bake | . | | | .

Performs an averaging of neighboring pixels with the normal distribution as weighting . This is the most basic blur filter available and really quick. Has the option to change blur size in X and Y independently. . Selective Gaussian blur . Blur neighboring pixels, but only in low contrast areas . This filter is more advanced and lets you set a threshold so that only similar pixels are blurred together. Should help retain sharp edges while reducing grain. This filter is much slower than Gaussian blur but this probably won’t amount to much addtional processing time unless working with a high resolution image. Unfortunately you cannot control blur in X&amp;Y independently instead it is controlled by a Blur radius. ",

Alternatively you can call this option and render via commandline using the following: . java -jar ChunkyLauncher.jar -tile-width x java -jar ChunkyLauncher.jar -render scene . In my limited testing of a scene that takes approximately 17 minutes I found that a tile-width of 16 seemed to provide a 3.5% boost to rendering speed over default. While this is a minimal improvement it would add up over time. A value of 256 or greater resulted in a significant reduction in rendering performance.

The first time you start Chunky Launcher you will be asked to pick a settings directory for Chunky. I personally do not use the recommended Home Directory install location.

The reason I do this will become clear with some of the advanced topics this guide will cover later. After making this selection the Chunky Launcher will be shown. Please hit Check for update to show any available updates and then Update to New Version to get Chunky Launcher to download required files. Once done hit Launch Chunky to use the downloaded version.

Opposed to completing the First time setup steps listed above, setting the Update Site field under Advanced Settings in the Chunky Launcher to http://chunkyupdate.llbit.se/ with the Download snapshotscheckbox disabled and clicking on Check for update should give you a download prompt for Chunky 1.4.5 (mc 1.2.1 - 1.12.2). Enabling Download snapshots and checking for updates again should give you Chunky 1.4.6 beta 2 which a few new features and bugs fixes including support for mc 1.13 resource packs ONLY (no support for mc 1.13 worlds). It it then recommended to switch the Update Site back to https://chunkyupdate.lemaik.de/, disabling Download snapshots, and checking and downloading Chunky 2.3.0 or any stable release prior to enabling Download snapshots. Following these steps should give you Chunky 1.4.5 &amp; 1.4.6b2 for Minecraft &lt;1.12.2 rendering and at least Chunky 2.3.0 (stable) with an experimental Chunky 2.4 build. If you have already performed the first time setup and cannot download older versions as a work around to this issue I will be providing copies of older Chunky versions in .zip files; which can be extracted into the root of your Chunky directory.

    "content": "With every intersection the sun is sampled adding its contribution to the ray without the need for random sampling; which is one of the main reasons why the convergence of scenes lit by the sun (and sky) occurs quickly. Emitters on the other hand need to be directly hit for them to contribute which has a lower probability of occuring; espically with smaller emitters like torchers. ESS enables similar sampling to which the sun uses and, in theory, should lead to faster convergence. However, whereas there is only a single sun present in the scene, there can be multiple emitters and those at distances where they will not contribute much to the image- For this we have the emittergrid which holds the positions of emitters within cells. When sampling we would only consider emitters within the cell at the intersection and adjacent cells; That way the cost of processing the addtional samples is minimalised. With ESS ONE only a single emitter is sampled per intersection and cell(+adj) &amp; for ALL every emitter in the cell(+adj) is sampled per intersection. Sampling emitters increases the rendering cost but reduces the required samples. ESS:ONE tends to be very similar to ESS:NONE with ESS:ALL being the “slowest” but potentially fastest to converge- ALL also tends to result in much brighter images than NONE/ONE so a reduction in exposure or emittance value is required to compensate for this. The emitter grid (cell) size changes the size of the cells which can impact how many emitters would need to be sampled per intersection, potentially improving performance, however this could lead to issues such as light cut-off if set too low.

More information . | Up, Down, Front, Back, Left, Right - Opens a file picker . | Skymap rotation - Rotates the skybox horizontally. | . Black - Not sure why we have this option given we have a Solid Color option. ~~~ . Transparent sky - Makes the sky transparent. Enable clouds - Toggles simple clouds on and off. Cloud size - Controls the scaling of the clouds (it’s a simple “3D” texture so it’ll change position). Cloud X - Shifts clouds along X axis. Cloud Y - Shifts clouds along Y axis. Cloud Z- Shifts clouds along Z axis . Fog density - Logarithmic scaled Fog density. The default of 0 is off. Scales between 0.001 and 1.0. Depending on scene composition the impact Fog density can have is variable. You may need to manually enter values into the text field to access densities between 0.0 - 0.001 and 1.0+. Sky fog blending - Controls the amount that Fog will bleed into the sky. This is not impacted by Fog density and can be used to help avoid masking a Sky Texture while still blending. Fog color - RGB picker. Water . Still water - Disables wavy water normals. Water visibility - Controls the distances rays can travel in water before being terminated. Water opacity - Controls the opacity of the water (mainly for color). Water plane - Toggles an infinite water plane. User custom water color - Toggle; Otherwise will use biome water color . Pick color - RGB picker. Camera . Load preset - Isometric (NW, NE, SE, SW), Skybox (Right, Left, Up, Down, Front (North), Back) . | Isometric - Sets camera to parallel with the camera aimed down at 45 degrees towards the center of the currently loaded chunks. Yaw depends on mode selected. | Skybox - From the center of the currently loaded chunks look towards that skybox. | . Camera - Allows a scene to have multiple independant camera which have different properties. | Clone - Clones selected camera . | Remove - Removes selected camera . | . Position &amp; Orientation . | Position - X, Y (height), Z . | Orientation - Yaw, Pitch, Roll . | Lense shift - Horizontal lense shift, Vertical lense shift : Relative to canvas height. | . Camera to player - Moves the selected camera to the “players” position. Which one? No clue. Center camera - Centers camera within currently loaded chunks. Projection mode . | Standard - Default pinhole projection. | Parallel . | Fisheye . | Stereographic . | Panoramic (equirectangular) . | Panoramic (slot) . | Omni-deirctional Stereo (left/right eye) . | . Field of view (zoom) . Depth of field - Lower values increase strength of Depth of field. Subject distance - Distance from camera to block/object you wish to focus on. Autofocus - Typically only useful for range finding (Subject Distance) unless working with closer blocks. DoF typically needs to be adjusted manually if looking for a stronger effect. Autofocues on the target block. Entities . Entity management. Allows the removal and creation of Entities while posing them. Materials . Filter - Filter materials list . Materials . Material Properties . Emittance - Disable or control the per block emittance intensity. Specular - Controls the specularity of blocks 0.0 - 1.0. IoR- Index of Refraction . NOTE - Support for PBR resource packs is WIP and will fundamentially change how this all functions. Postprocessing . Exposure - Changes the images exposure. Postprocessing mode - Changes the tonemap used. | None . | Gamma correction . | Tonemap operator 1 . | ACES filmic tonemapping - Darker than other tonemaps; raise exposure. | Hable tonemapping . | . Advanced . Render threads - Changes the number of threads Chunky should use while rendering. (Needs restart) . CPU utilization - Adds in sleep cycles to the rendering process to attempt to reduce the CPU usage. Would recommend using Render threads for more predictable scaling. Ray depth - Controls the number of times a ray is allowed to bounce without striking a light source before killed. For outdoor scenes a value between 3-5 should typically be enough with indoor scenes benifitting more from higher values around 10. Higher values offer more realistic light bounce however at a cost to render time. Balance this carefully. Merge render dump - Useful for multi-PC rendering. Merges a renders .dump file into the currently loaded scene combining the total SPP. Shutdown computer when render completes - Toggle. Fast Fog - Impacts the quality of fog rendering. Typically only noticable if viewing fog through alpha textures which is rare. Sky cache resolution - Resolution of the rendered simulated sky. Lower values may boost rendering performance at the cost of sky model accuracy. Output mode - PNG (default), TIFF, 32-bit floating point, PFM, Portable FloatMap (32-bit) . Octree implementation - PACKED (default), BIGPACKED, NODE (legacy) . Emitter grid size- Controls size of emitter grid. Prevent normal emitter when using emitter sampling - Attempts to disable typical random emitter hits which would reduce noise. Help . Camera bindings, see Render Preview for up-to-date controls. ",
