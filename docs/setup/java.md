As stated in Installation, Chunky requires Java 8 update 40 or later (with JavaFX) and it is recommended that you use the 64 bit Java version if you have a 64 bit OS.

## Java Downloads

[Oracle Java 8 (including JavaFX)](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

JavaFX/OpenJFX are often the short straw and unfortunately Chunky needs them. Below are a few solutions depending on platform and Java version.

### OpenJDK 8 OpenJFX fix on Ubuntu

**NOTE** - This script is currently not working. If anyone can fix it please let me know or PR the fix.

Below is a script you can run on Ubuntu to obtain and retain a working OpenJFX. *credit - UNuX#1985 - 11/07/2019*


```
#!/bin/bash
su
apt install openjdk-8-jre
mkdir -p /tmp/chunky-deps-tmp
cd /tmp/chunky-deps-tmp
wget https://launchpadlibrarian.net/363521276/libopenjfx-jni_8u161-b12-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb
wget https://launchpadlibrarian.net/363521272/libopenjfx-java_8u161-b12-1ubuntu2_all.deb
wget https://launchpadlibrarian.net/363521275/openjfx_8u161-b12-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb
dpkg -i *.deb
apt-mark hold openjfx libopenjfx-java libopenjfx-jni
```

### OpenJDK 8 OpenJFX fix on Windows

On Windows, OpenJDK does not come with OpenJFX and is does not, at the time of writing, have an official source. Instead you will need to find a pre-compiled build though I would not recommend this.

---

### What about Java 11+?

If you wish to run Chunky on Java 11+ you will need to ensure you have ChunkyLauncher v1.12.1, or later, in addtion to OpenJFX.

---

#### OpenJDK 11+ OpenJFX on Ubuntu

1. Install OpenJDK

`sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk`

2. Install OpenJFX

`sudo apt install openjfx`

3. Right click on ChunkyLauncher.jar

	a) Properties, Permissions, Execute: Ticked

	b) Open With, OpenJDK Java 11 Runtime (or eqv)

4. Double click on ChunkyLauncher.jar

Note - ChunkyLauncher should auto find OpenJFX in a number of locations: Within `/usr/share/openjfx/lib`, `/usr/lib/jvm/java-<javaVersion>-openjdk`, `.chunky`, or the extracted folder contains `javafx` though this is crude.

---

#### OpenJDK 11+ OpenJFX on Windows

1. Install the OpenJDK of your choice.

2. Download the [OpenJFX Windows SDK from gluonhq](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/), extract to `C:\Program Files\openjfx` with the folder structure seen below.

{% responsive_image path: "assets/images/installation/openjfx_folder.png" %}

Note - ChunkyLauncher should auto find OpenJFX in a number of locations: Within `/.chunky/`, or alongside your `jre` or `jdk` install (ie merging /lib/ folders), or the extracted folder contains `javafx` though this is crude.

3. Launch ChunkyLauncher.jar either by double clicking the .jar file or by using `java -jar "path\to\chunkylauncher\chunkylauncher.jar"`

4. Inside ChunkyLauncher, under Advanced Settings, the `Java options` field should be auto-populated with `--module-path` and `--add-modules` which point towards the openjfx install location.

    ie

    `--module-path "C:\Program Files\openjfx" --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.base,javafx.graphics,javafx.fxml`


Note

If you get the following error: `java.lang.LayerInstantiationException: Package jdk.internal.jimage in both module java.base and module jrt.fs`, open `C:\Program Files\openjfx\lib` and delete `jrt-fs.jar`; However this issue typically occurs if you merge OpenJFX's `lib` folder into your OpenJDK `lib` folder.

---

## Double clicking ChunkyLauncher.jar doesn't work on Windows?

A common issue with Java on Windows is that jar files may not be correctly associated with Java.

This can be fixed by either uninstalling and reinstalling Java or through using an application like [Jarfix](https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html) or through launching via CMD, ie `java -jar "path\to\chunkylauncher\chunkylauncher.jar"`.

---

## Batch script to launch (Windows)

Don't want to have to type out commands each time you want to launch Chunky? Well in comes Batch scripts!

Create a `.txt` file and enter the following lines, adjusting them where necessary to match the commands you need, then save the file as a `.bat` file in the same directory as ChunkyLauncher.jar.

```
cd /d %~dp0
java -jar ChunkyLauncher.jar --launcher
pause
```

You can then right click the .bat file and create a shortcut which can be place on the desktop, pinned to the taskbar, etc.
