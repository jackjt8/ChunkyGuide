<div align="center">Chunky is a Minecraft rendering tool that uses Path Tracing to create realistic images of your Minecraft worlds.</div>

<div align="center" style="background-color:#a35a00">
This guide was orginally created back when we did not have access to make changes to Chunky's original site at chunky.llbit.se. As Chunky has developed over the years things have changed. We now have a new and up to date site, <a href="https://chunky-dev.github.io/docs/"> Chunky Manual </a>, which we have worked tirelessly to create. As such the majority of the content here is no longer required. This guide will live on as a place to find more advanced techniques.

<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

<div align="center">
I have used Chunky for over 7 years now and in this time I have produced in excess of 400 renders. Over the years I have learnt so much and I feel it's time to put everything in writing. This guide is an accumulation of knowledge and I very much hope that others will add to it so it can evolve and become something more.
